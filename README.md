Hello everyone! You can install it as I explained step by step. Create your own fake api.

Step 1 - Create git repository

Step 2
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/boylcn/json-server-fake-api.git
```

Step 3 - Add package.json by using this command npm init -y

Step 4 - Install some dependency by using this command 

```bash
  npm i json-server cors json-serve
```

Step 5 - Add db.json and add .gitignore file

After all this steps are completed use this command to push the code in your Github account.

```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your message"
  git push origin main
```

That's it! Happy coding.
